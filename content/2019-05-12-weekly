Not much to tell this past week, unfortunately. I've been very busy with personal matters. Well, that - and playing [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)

I've been playing around with Amethyst and *finally* got a sprite displaying! I'm trying to develop something similar to a VN engine, which I think is a very attainable goal. 

This week, I'm most likely going to accomplish little in terms of volunteer and side projects due to ongoing personal matters. But if I get an oppurtunity, I'd like to explore Amethyst a bit more, finish up some pages for rust.audio, and further update my personal site to fix a few bugs and improve performance.
